# Turnbasedgame Poker Platform

A real-time, two-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker platform built with C++ backend and Next.js frontend.

## Overview

This project implements a full-stack poker gaming platform with:
- **Real-time gameplay** via WebSocket communication
- **Server-authoritative game logic** in C++17
- **Modern React frontend** with Next.js 16 and TypeScript
- **Responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI components
- **Auto-reconnection** and session persistence
- **WCAG AA compliant** accessibility

## Current Status

**✅ Architecture Complete** - Full architecture documented with decisions and patterns  
**✅ Shared Types Defined** - JSON schemas for WebSocket communication  
**✅ Project Structure Initialized** - Complete directory tree for both frontend and backend  
**✅ WebSocket Connectivity** - Client and server WebSocket implementation with session tokens  
**✅ Frontend Components** - Poker table, betting controls, player seats, and UI components  
**✅ Basic Game Logic** - Simple poker game state management in C++  

**🚧 Next Steps** - Install dependencies, build, test, and enhance game logic

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- C++17 compiler (g++ 9+ or clang 10+)
- CMake 3.15+
- libhv 1.3.4+ (C++ network library)
- nlohmann/json (C++ JSON library)

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install libhv (example - check libhv documentation)
   git clone https://github.com/ithewei/libhv.git
   cd libhv
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. && make && sudo make install
   
   # Install nlohmann/json (usually header-only)
   sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
   # Or download single header: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
   ```

2. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Frontend
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Backend
   cd server
   mkdir -p build && cd build
   cmake .. && make
   ./poker_server
   ```

3. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000

### Quick Test with Build Scripts

```bash
# Run development setup script
./scripts/dev.sh

# Build everything
./scripts/build-all.sh

# Run server
cd server/build && ./poker_server
```

The server will be available on port 8080, serving both static frontend files and WebSocket API.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Real-time Communication
- WebSocket connection management with auto-reconnect
- Session token persistence in localStorage
- Heartbeat monitoring and latency measurement
- Structured JSON messages with validation

### ✅ Frontend UI
- Responsive poker table with felt design
- Player seat components with chip stacks and cards
- Community cards display
- Betting controls (check, call, raise, fold)
- Connection status indicator
- Error handling and display

### ✅ Server Infrastructure
- Combined HTTP/WebSocket server using libhv
- Session management with token validation
- Basic poker game state management
- Message routing and error handling

### 🚧 In Progress
- Complete poker game logic (deck, hand ranking, betting rounds)
- Multi-player synchronization (broadcasting to both players)
- Disconnection recovery with state preservation
- Enhanced UI with card graphics and animations

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **C++**: snake_case for files and functions, Google C++ style guide
- **TypeScript**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables
- **JSON**: snake_case for all field names (critical for consistency)
- **Card Format**: `<rank><suit>` e.g., `"Ah"`, `"Kd"`, `"7c"`

### Communication Patterns
- **Full State Broadcast**: Server sends complete game state on every change
- **Optimistic Updates**: Client updates UI immediately for player actions
- **Auto-reconnection**: Exponential backoff with session token persistence
- **Error Handling**: Structured error codes with user-friendly messages

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server/build
   ./poker_server
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open two browser windows** (simulating two players):
   - Both connect to http://localhost:3000
   - Each should see the poker table with player positions
   - Betting actions will update game state (basic implementation)

## Next Development Steps

1. **Install missing C++ dependencies** (libhv, nlohmann/json)
2. **Implement complete poker logic**:
   - Deck shuffling and card dealing
   - Hand ranking (Texas Hold'em rules)
   - Betting rounds (preflop, flop, turn, river)
   - Pot calculation and side pots
3. **Add multiplayer synchronization**:
   - Broadcast game state to all connected players
   - Handle concurrent actions
4. **Enhance UI**:
   - Card graphics (SVG or images)
   - Chip animations
   - Sound effects
   - Timer with visual countdown
5. **Add testing**:
   - Unit tests for game logic
   - Integration tests for WebSocket communication
   - End-to-end browser tests

## Deployment

### Linux VPS Deployment
```bash
# Build everything
./scripts/build-all.sh

# Deploy (adjust path as needed)
./scripts/deploy.sh /opt/turnbasedgame

# Start service
sudo systemctl start turnbasedgame
```

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`: WebSocket URL for frontend (default: ws://localhost:8080)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that libhv and nlohmann/json are properly installed
2. Verify the server builds without errors
3. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
4. Review `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/shared-types.md` for implementation details
